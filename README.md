# Exploring KNB
This repo has the data, code and reports for my exploratary analysis on KNB, which is a website that aggregates ecology related datasets. 

## Accessing the data in KNB
In order to access the data in KNB programmatically, I downloaded their API. Then following Ciera's suggestion, I was able to find the most popular headers in their database, under the help of the KNB staff. Playing with the headers, I decided to work on the datasets from [PISCO](http://www.piscoweb.org) and I need combine all the datasets first, which are around 200GB in total.
