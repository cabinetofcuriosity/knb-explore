They looked emaciated and were actually falling apart. At first I was attributing it to a star that had a trap land on it and maybe some predation that occurs from crabs. But; this was something else.  I received an e-mail from Thank You Oceans explaining there was a sea star withering event taking place in California. I contacted Pete Ramondi and told him of my findings. I had several pieces of pink star that were frozen for his investigation. It seemed these samples were not needed and I discarded them. I did; however; collect a few samples a few months ago; during April; and have them frozen. These samples seem to have survived even with only two legs intact but the body seems normal.  It became difficult to collect any samples at all since there now are very few stars to be found; period. I even tried hang bait; fish heads; and still no stars.  I guess the clams and moon snails will be happy about that. LOL From conversations with other crabbers in the area from Pedro Point to Flyshaker's and out to 7 miles; there are little to very few stars that appear healthy at this time.  The event seems to have passed and I did manage to get one healthy pink star on my last pull that was in late May 2014.  That's it for now. Hope we can find what is going on.","yes"

We did not count them but saw quite a few moderate sized animals that were probably survivors of the SSWD and we also saw the small one (photo number 4). We returned again yesterday (2 May) and the students from Mission College did a thorough count. I don't recall how many they found (they haven't recorded it yet) but it was considerable and we can say the stars are returning. Most were also moderately sized but they found one very small one-- with diseased spots. That one is in the Almar photos 5 and 6. Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Entered by MR from email.","yes"

Prior to this trip, the last sea star I noticed was in November 9, 2013 in the Sooke Basin and they were plentiful. So it was great to see some 14 Ochre Sea Stars (Pisaster Ochraceus) half orange and half purple on March 10, 2015 on the outer coast near Cabin Point and between there and Beecher Bay, BC - a distance of some 4.5 nm. There were 1 to 3 ft below the surface and med low tide and were 5-8"" in diameterI tip to tip. I also observed 5 of what we call Blood Stars which are very small - maybe 4"" across, very skinny like the Troschel's (Henricia levioscula) and bright blood red. These are the first sea stars I have seen in almost 2 years. One of the PO's had a large white spot on it which makes we wonder if the seastar wasting disease is still present. I keep and eye out for them and other life as I paddle almost weekly year round. This Wed, April 1, I noticed 4 more Ochre Stars (purple) on the Haro Strait coastline which I'll report separately. Hope this is helpful. I'll try and get some photos in the future.","yes"

Also present were P. brevespinus; P. ochraceus; and even 4 or 5 Pyncnopodia also in the 4-6 inch diam. size. The E. troscheli was by far the most common. I was surprised to see at least a dozen P. ochraceus at Cama. These tended to be in the 3-5 inch size range. There were a few giant pinks that were probably 12 inches in diam. Almost a full moon; no wind; temp. just above freezing. So maybe the SWS disease has at least for now abated.

Consequently I tried to cover it all but at the end as the tide was flooding the last portion was not done as thoroughly as I would have liked. I counted all specimens that I could see without over turning rocks so undoubtedly more were present than tallied. The tally follows: purple star Pisaster ochraceus -- 433 individuals 3 obviously wasting perhaps 30 % were juveniles;pink star Pisaster brevispinus 2 juveniles mottled star Evasterias troschelii 9 juveniles one obviously wasting. leather star Dermasterias imbricata 14 individuals mostly small; about half were found upside down.

Disease rates for Leptasterias; several species; were Ã¢â€°Â¤ 10% and mostly mildly diseased. All other species showed no signs of disease including Pycnopodia that were also well distributed.

This is the site where prior to October 2013; there were thousands upon thousands of large Pycnopodia on the shallow rocky slopes. We saw the first signs of trouble on Oct. 9 2013 when we noticed some of them with SSWD. By Oct. 29 2013; they had been entirely wiped out along with the small numbers of Solaster dawsoni. Many Evasterias and Pisaster ochraceus also died but not all. The Dermasterias seemed unaffected. On our recent visit we found very large numbers of Dermasterias in the shallows working over the mussel beds. Evasterias is also doing very well with lots of large apparently healthy specimens. We also observed thousands of tiny (5 mm) juveniles of this species. Pisaster ochraceus is abundant in the shallows and the specimens looked fat and healthy. Over the course of two hour-long dives we found only a single small (10 cm diam.) Pycnopodia. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to understand why (almost 3 years later) this species has not recovered while Evasterias and Pisaster ochraceus have. No Solaster dawsoni were observed. A few Henricia were observed.

Findings similar to May sampling. Stylasterias: Sept numbers comparable with what was found in May; saw about 30 stars (to 60cm diameter). Most seemed healthy; a few in 20 ft of water. Found one ray that was quite decomposed (*I'm calling this SSWS). Dermasterias: same as May; species abundant at site and no SSWS observed. Solaster endeca: found 1 healthy.

The good news is that I did not see any Ã¢â‚¬Å“newÃ¢â‚¬Â SSWD except for one situation where I found several Dermasterias eating dismembered rays of a Stylasterias. Hard to say what happened to the Stylasterias but it was up in shallow water (20 ft deep) where the salinity is quite reduced in Howe Sound due to the incredible amount of rain we had in March. Perhaps it could not tolerate this. So I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t say for sure this was SSWD. I found only half a dozen small Pycnopodia; so they have made virtually no recovery from the devastation of October 2013. Please see the attached data report for details. Prior to October 2013; when SSWD hit hard; there were thousands of large (to 50 cm diam.) Pycnopodia helianthoides at this site. All of them and all the Solaster dawsoni were wiped out in a couple of weeks. To date there has been virtually zero recovery of either of these species. This site has more Stylasterias forreri than any other IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen in BC; especially large ones too.

They were in the headland and in large crevasses in the rock about 2' below the surface, a rather protected spot given the overall exposure of the headland - tide was quite low. I did not notice any white spots and they looked quite healthy. These are the first sea stars I have noticed along this coast in a couple of years. Hopefully it is a sign of their gradual return to the coastline here on Southern Vancouver Island. In years previous to 2014, they were very plentiful in this area.","yes"

After the purge all that was left were a few Purples and lots of Leathers.. In the beginning of last summer quite a few Purples reappeared where their slain brethren had traditionally clustered together on the Heriot Island rock face exposed at low tide. I assumed these came from deeper water. By the end of last summer most had melted away leaving only lots of large Leathers.. This spring new Purples could again be found in small clusters on the rock face and there were some Mottled and even a few juvenile Sunflowers as well.  Last week many were looking limp and lots had white spots. Four days ago many were falling apart and yesterday most were gone; with only some dismembered purple arms scattered around.","yes"

Gorgeous morning. The last time I was out I found only two purple stars. This time I found 9; 8 purple and 1 orange. I am attaching photos of 8 or the 9 stars for you to see (the 9th was too hidden in a crevice.) As you can see all were medium to large sized animals. Either these stars grow must faster that we thought; or they were survivors that were somehow hidden away. I did not find any that might be considered to be recruits. I am copying Steve Litvin and Fio Micheli who have been looking at both stars and mussel boundaries at Feder's Area 2 where I spent some time today. I think you told me you were seeing recruits there Steve. Maybe I can go out with you sometime and you can show me where they are. I also took photos of the lower boundaries of the the mussels; and in many places it does look like mussels are filling in below the lower boundary seen in my earlier photos beginning in early 2014. I think that is what you have been seeing Steve and Fio-- is that correct? Mostly the change looks pretty scattered and subtle but in two places there is a fairly solid cover of small-medium sized mussels. Puzzling that there is so much variation. And what is happening at Hopkins (or the Monterey Bay area?) does not seem much like what was reported by Kwiatdowski et al. for Oregon. Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Entered by MR from email.","yes"

I was glad to see how healthy they looked even though there were not very many. I probably saw about 20 in a 200' long stretch of rocks on a -2.5ish low tide. I was excited to go back for another low tide with my camera but when I went on August 10; 2014 I could not find ANY healthy stars.

Today I saw one and I had to wade out another couple of feet to photograph it at a -1.2 tide. In my previous entry I labeled this same type of sea star as a Bat star and I now believe them to be Leather stars. In March of 2014 I have a number of photos of what appear to be healthy sea stars so I believe the decline in this area to have come just in the past couple of months. 5/15/2014: I have been taking close-up photographs of sea stars on our beach since moving here in July 2012. There is a very dramatic decrease in the number of sea stars compared to this time last year when they all appeared very healthy. On June 14 2014 we had a minus 3.1 tide and I only saw four sea stars. I believe they were all Asterino miniata and I did not see any signs of disease; but that was before I read more about the wasting disease. Last year I would have easily seen more than 50 sea stars during a similar minus tide. There would have been many Ochre; plus Giant Pink; Blood Stars; Mottled Stars; and a few Sunflower and I believe young Bat Stars. I have lots of photos to document any of these sea stars. The May 15 observation showed one diseased Sunflower with one limb nearby; as well as a diseased ochre and perhaps one that was not showing signs of disease. I'm not completely sure of my identification of Bat stars. They're definitely red with short broad arms; but their surface seems pretty smooth.","yes"

The puzzling thing is that the stars in shallower; and warmer water are all healthy while the ones in somewhat deeper water are sick. The water data from nearby Penn Cove Mussel Farm show almost ten degrees temperature difference between 3 and 23 feet of depth. I wonder if the Oxygen levels have something to do with it. At the depth below 25 feet I am seeing first signs of the Dead Zone effect I witnessed here last two years at the same September-October period. Many Nuttalls cockle; usually buried with only siphons visible are now on the surface; some with their foot fully exposed not moving away from any predator. Also Brittle stars are now on the surface another indication of stress since they are always buried too. Unfortunately the visibility is only few feet so more extensive survey is difficult. In short it is not a pretty sight.","yes"

Louise on Nov. 5 2014 at low tide to check the sea stars. On the west side of the point; among large rocks; I noticed several that looked like they were beginning to show disease symptoms.  At first I thought it may have just been the water draining from them; from the tide being out.  But then I saw one that definitely looked diseased - white blotches; legs shriveling up.  I filmed them all with my HD cam. I will send a screen shot from the video; and a youtube link where you can view the video.  I am not an expert re: which species it is. I could be wrong - just looking at pictures of the species on your list; I think it was the first one. Sincerely; Steven""","yes"

As a child through my early to mid teen years this same rocky intertidal zone had enormous numbers of sea stars of all varieties and colors. It was extremely rich and diverse in intertidal sea life; and a large variety of maturity; as well.. One caveat is that around 2001 3 buses of kids from the state park stripped 30 species from the rocks. The caretaker at WWU said this weekend that rangers filled 30 buckets with species that had been strewn about. So this area has been impacted prior to the sea star wasting. The park has been working to rehabilitate the area; and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shoeing signs of recovery; but is just beginning; and vastly different in whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s present compared to my childhood; inclusive of the algae.

This is a submerged rocky reef that comes to within about 5 m of the surface. I surveyed the reef summit thoroughly and also had a look into deeper water down to about 25 m depth.The summit of this reef is at 49 34.023N x 123 48.208W.In the Ã¢â‚¬Å“good old daysÃ¢â‚¬Â two years ago before SSWD this was a very starry place with lots of big Pycnopodia and Solaster dawsoni as well as hundreds of Crossaster.The latest survey showed:Pycnopodia helianthoides: Nearly four hours of diving and only one small animal on the reef top to show for it. This species is not making any kind of sustained recovery here.  Solaster dawsoni: Fewer than 10 small (less than 6 cm diam.) observed. None with SSWD.  Crossaster papposus: Still hundreds scattered over the entire reef, but a significant number (estimated at 5%) with SSWD. A few animals that looked OK but with one or two slightly limp or twisted rays were tested by flipping them upside down. Healthy stars immediately initiate a righting response while sick ones show no righting response. See pics of specimen A.  Solaster stimpsoni: Only one small (8 cm diam.) specimen seen.Pisaster brevispinus: A few large specimens observed, one with coiled rays (see pic). Hard to tell if this animal had SSWD or not.Pisaster ochraceus: Did not dive shallow enough to find this species.Henricia spp.: Fairly common and none seen with SSWD. Evasterias troschelii: Common, with some large specimens (35 cm diam.). Found one separated ray due to SSWD (see pic).Lophaster furcilliger vexator: One specimen at depth of 25 m.Hippasteria phrygiana: Two specimens. One had a missing ray tip but not sure if a result of SSWD.Pteraster tesselatus: Small numbers, none with SSWD.Orthasterias koehleri: Several dozen, none with SSWD.Dermasterias imbricata: Common on reef and of large size (to 30 cm in diam.).

SSWD continues to kill sea stars on this reef despite much colder water temperatures than during the summer months. Crossaster papposus is the most abundant star on this reef. I saw perhaps a hundred during the dives and found three with SSWD, all in the shallows. I would estimate less than 5% of this species have obvious SSWD. Solaster dawsoni: found only one small specimen. There used to be dozens, large and small. Pycnopodia helianthoides: could not find a single specimen, even a small one! There used to be dozens, including some very large ones. Evasterias troschelii: a few on the reef, most looked OK, but I did find one large specimen (30 cm diam.) that had SSWD. Orthasterias koehleri: fairly common and none seen with SSWD. Pteraster tesselatus: a few on the reef, none seen with SSWD. Pisaster brevispinus: did not find a single specimen. Used to be quite common on the reef. Pisaster ochraceus: none on the reef top, but there could be some closer to shore in the shallows where I did not explore. Henricia spp.: lots of small H. leviuscula which were OK but my dive buddy Tom Sheldon found one Henricia which looks like H. aspera aspera with SSWD.

I found a single star at Corral Harbor (small size; but not newly recruited). I did; however; see several adult stars on the barge pier pilings. Some pilings had five or more adults on them; with no signs of wasting. It does appear that intertidal urchin numbers are down significantly. I did not see any signs of active die-off; but many locations that usually have abundant urchins were much less dense. We should get some data on this from Glenn's and Fish and Wildlife's presence/absence information and Mike Kenner's quadrats when they are done this year. Anecdotally; it looks like black abalone are more exposed (out on top of rocks and on vertical rock faces). These were not new recruits; but large abalone that appear to have moved into more open habitats. Again; this should show up in the data for this season's surveys. If what I think I'm seeing is supported by data; this could be a very interesting potential sign of release from predation.","yes"

The beach is mostly sandy there, but a low tide reveals rocks and tide pools. I am not a biologist, but I have visited this area before, most recently in 2013. I was shocked by how few sea stars I observed during today's minus tide compared to previous visits. In previous years, I saw dozens and dozens of sea stars in this area. Today I saw about seven, and most of those looked diseased: missing arms, or the sea star was barely hanging onto the rock, or it looked kind of white and deflated.

While I saw no diseased stars; there was a complete absence of several species that were numerous last summer. No Pycnopodia helianthoides; no Pisaster breivispinus; no mature Evasterias troschellii. Last year there were pink sea stars every five feet on the beach on the east side of Steamboat Island and numerous ones in the intertidal sand of northern Totten Inlet. There were no pink stars at all this year. Last year; we saw at least 100 P. ochraceus at the north end of the island with incredible color variations- there were blue ones; golden ones; and maroon ones along with the common purple and ochre. This year there were only three purple mature stars. None showed lesions. There was one large Dermasterias imbricata cruising along; showing no ill effects. We believe it was the same one we saw there last year-- lots of  sea cucumbers for him to eat with the sunflower stars gone. Last year we found a couple of Solaster dawsonii with arms falling off at this site- did not know about the wasting disease at that time; so assumed a sea gull attack had occurred. No S. dawsonii seen this year. And most significantly; no Pycnopodias at all. Last year; lots of very large adults and dozens of juveniles.  On a positive note; we found five healthy juvenile Evasterias stars two inches in diameter or less.  Pisasters at this site can fluctuate; but it is unheard of not to see lots of sunflower and pink stars on this beach-- my assumption is they have been wiped out at this site.""","yes"

The spread of SSWS has been rapid and quite shocking. We've wondered if we should be asking Asian and Euro visitor's to wash their shoes; etc; before return to their homeland as we've had hundreds of visitors to the tide pool areas.  We have had frustrating difficulty getting any info on precautions; policy; etc.  OSU Hatfield marine center have been of no use what-so-ever.  After much prompting they have planned an orientation for Oct 2014.  At the present rate of infection and death; the entire population here could very well be extinct. There is a very talented and willing volunteer here and in Yachat's; Newport; etc.  Please respond with any additional information that may be helpful ASAP. PLEASE!
